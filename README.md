# INET4031 PHP Crude CRUD App (MariaDB/MySQL DB Version)

## Demonstrates a basic Dynamic HTML Application using PHP

This project demonstrates a basic dynamic web application using PHP to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with a MariaDB/MySQL database. It is designed to help users understand how data-driven web applications function and serves as a starting point for exploring modern web development frameworks. The application assumes a pre-configured "employees" database and includes a credentials.php file for database connection details, which must be updated to match your local configuration. While functional, this application is not secure for production useâ€”credentials and sensitive data are exposed in the files. Future improvements could include implementing security best practices, integrating modern frameworks, and enhancing the user interface for a more robust and professional application.
